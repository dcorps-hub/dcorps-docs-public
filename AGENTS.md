# Agent instructions for `dcorps-docs`

These instructions apply to all files in this repository.

## General coding and docs conventions
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the user’s request.
- Match the existing structure and formatting of nearby content.
- Do not introduce new tools, frameworks, or concepts unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer clear, direct language and avoid unnecessary jargon.

## Website and documentation text improvements
When the user asks to improve or rewrite text for a page or document in this repo:
- Preserve factual/technical accuracy; do not invent features or promises.
- Keep the tone: professional, concise, and friendly, similar to existing docs.
- Prefer short sentences, active voice, and concrete wording.
- Balance brevity and depth: avoid vague, ultra-short copy and also avoid long, dense blocks; use paragraphs and bullets to keep it readable.
- Aim for “top marketing + informative”: clearly explain what it is, who it’s for, how it helps, and what to do next, while highlighting real benefits and differentiation.
- Use headings and bullets where it improves scanability, but don’t over-fragment.
- Make the value/benefit clear early in each section.
- Avoid hypey marketing language; focus on clarity, credibility, and usefulness.
- Keep terminology consistent with the rest of the project (“dCorps”, product names, etc.).
- If something is ambiguous or underspecified, prefer neutral phrasing rather than guessing.

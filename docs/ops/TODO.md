## Documents to produce

### Key principles to capture

- General/DevCo ownership; DevCo 100 percent founder owned at start.
- General/Founder split; 15 percent founder allocation with internal 10+5 division.
- General/No founder dilution; Founder tokens never used for advisors or contributors.
- General/No DevCo equity sold; No equity investors until later optional stage.

### Seed and round structure

- Funding/Seed round; Done before foundation, rights to future DCHUB.
- Funding/Seed proceeds; All Seed USDC stays in DevCo.
- Funding/Seed token source; From investor allocation or sale bucket, never founder stack.
- Funding/Round A; Run by foundation once mainnet live.
- Funding/Public sale; Tokens from investor or sale pool only.

### Token and team allocations

- Tokenomics/Founder allocation; Public category stays 15 percent.
- Tokenomics/Contributor pool; Advisors and early contributors paid from team 15 percent pool.
- Tokenomics/Internal split; DevCo receives part of founder allocation formally documented.
- Tokenomics/Vesting rules; Final rules written in Governance Charter and Token Policy.

### Legal and governance

- Legal/Seed contracts; SAFT or warrant issued by DevCo.
- Legal/DevCo funding to foundation; Via service contract or formal loan.
- Legal/Advisory contracts; DevCo signs early, foundation assumes obligations later.
- Legal/No equity link; Foundation does not own DevCo equity.
- Governance/Founder voting; Unvested voting or hybrid defined in Governance Charter.
- Governance/Treasury voting; Treasury and foundation tokens non voting or restricted.

### DevCo and foundation relationship

- Structure/Preferred provider; DevCo early preferred development provider under contract.
- Structure/Not monopoly; Foundation free to add more providers later.
- Structure/Service contracts; DevCo paid through contracts, not hard coded in protocol.
- Structure/Long term path; Clear route to decentralization over time.

### Whitepaper and public docs

- Whitepaper/Pointer; Add one line pointing to Token Policy and Governance Charter.
- Tokenomics/High level; Public charts show single 15 percent founder category.
- Public/Seed vs A; Clear diagram showing Seed to DevCo, A to foundation.
- Public/No DevCo equity; Clarify DevCo equity not part of token sales.

### Persona docs and communication

- Persona/Entrepreneur brief; Note DevCo runs as a dCorps Hub corporation itself.
- Persona/NGO brief; Foundation uses dCorps NGO module.
- Persona/Developer brief; DevCo initial provider, others welcome later.

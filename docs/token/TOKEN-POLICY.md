## 1. Purpose and nature of DCHUB

DCHUB is the native token of the dCorps Hub. It is intended to serve as:

- the gas token for transactions on the Hub;
- the staking token providing economic security for consensus;
- a governance token for on-chain decision-making;
- the economic root for recognition and anchoring relationships with sub chains.

DCHUB is not:

- equity or shares in any corporation or nonprofit;
- a right to dividends, profits, or residual assets;
- a guarantee of price appreciation or investment performance.

Any sale, distribution, or other transfer of DCHUB that might have legal implications is handled under separate, dedicated documentation and terms.

## 2. Utility and use cases

DCHUB’s intended uses include:

- paying transaction fees on the Hub;
- staking to participate in consensus and earn rewards;
- delegating to validators to share in staking rewards and support network security;
- bonding or depositing for sub chain recognition or module-related economics where specified.

Governance may introduce additional protocol-level uses consistent with this policy, but should avoid overloading DCHUB with functions that create confusion about its nature.

Applications and services may accept DCHUB for their own purposes, but such uses are outside the scope of this policy and are the responsibility of those applications.

## 3. Supply and monetary policy

This policy provides high-level guidance; detailed figures and schedules are defined in `TOKEN-GENESIS-PLAN.md` and `TOKEN-EMISSIONS-NOTES.md`.

Principles:

- target a sustainable security budget for staking and network operations;
- avoid unnecessary inflation once the network reaches maturity;
- maintain flexibility to adjust parameters through governance as conditions change.

Potential supply components include:

- an initial genesis allocation;
- protocol-level emissions (if any) for staking rewards;
- allocations for ecosystem growth, research, and foundation operations.

Any changes to monetary policy are:

- debated transparently;
- enacted via on-chain governance;
- documented in the Master Reference and changelog.

## 4. Governance over token parameters

On-chain governance may control:

- inflation rates and emission curves where applicable;
- minimum and maximum staking reward rates;
- parameters governing recognition deposits and fees;
- distribution mechanisms for community or ecosystem allocations.

High-impact changes (e.g. major shifts in inflation or supply) should:

- have stronger approval thresholds and longer voting periods;
- be accompanied by analysis, scenarios, and stress tests;
- be recorded in `DECISION_LOG.md` with clear rationale.

Governance may not retroactively change the terms of any legal agreements or contracts under which DCHUB has already been sold or granted; those remain governed by their own documentation.

## 5. Disclaimers and legal boundaries

This policy:

- does not constitute legal, tax, or investment advice;
- does not create any entitlement to tokens or rights for any person;
- is subject to change as legal guidance and regulatory landscapes evolve.

Participants are responsible for:

- understanding and complying with laws in relevant jurisdictions;
- obtaining professional advice where appropriate;
- making their own risk assessments when acquiring, holding, or using DCHUB.

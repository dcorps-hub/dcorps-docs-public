> Scope: Public overview of the entities around dCorps (DevCo, ResCo, and the planned foundation), and how they are intended to relate.

Status note: dCorps is founder-led in Phase 0A (development). Unless explicitly stated otherwise, items below describe intended structure and are not executed legal arrangements.

---

## DevCo (planned; incorporation pending)

- **DevCo (Development Company)** — planned legal entity (design intention): **dCorps Development Ltd.** (intended jurisdiction: **British Virgin Islands (BVI)**; incorporation pending).
  - Intended role: protocol and tooling engineering services, integrations, and delivery support.
  - Intended posture: a services provider, not the protocol steward by default.

See: [DevCo Agreement](/legal/DEVCO_AGREEMENT).

---

## ResCo (planned; incorporation pending)

- **ResCo (Research Company)** — planned legal entity (design intention): **dCorps Research LLC** (intended jurisdiction: **Wyoming (USA)**; incorporation pending).

ResCo is intended to focus exclusively on dCorps Hub and protocol adoption: it analyzes adoption requirements across engineering, policy, legal, and operational constraints, then translates those findings into concrete module proposals and integration plans.

Design intention:

- Produce adoption research and strategy for specific jurisdictions, states, sectors, and industries.
- Deliver “adoption packages” to the foundation and ecosystem: module specifications, integration requirements, partner maps, and rollout playbooks (non-binding; subject to governance, audits, and legal constraints).
- Coordinate external specialists where needed (for example local counsel, policy experts, and government-relations/lobbying firms) to support serious, jurisdiction-specific adoption work—without implying guarantees or outcomes.

See: [ResCo Agreement](/legal/RESCO_AGREEMENT).

## dCorps Foundation (planned; not yet incorporated)

- Intended role: neutral nonprofit steward of public goods (standards, conformance, audits coordination, ecosystem programs).
- Intended boundary: stewardship and coordination, not legal authority, and not automatic legal personhood for users.
- Formation timing and jurisdiction are not finalized. Incorporation details, board structure, and policies will be published when finalized.

See: [Foundation Policy](/policy/POL-FOUNDATION) and [Governance Transition Plan](/policy/POL-GOV-TRANSITION).

## Phase 0 roles

Phase 0 is pre-mainnet readiness. Roles below describe the minimal coverage typically needed to ship a protocol and reference tooling with conservative safety posture.

### Engineering and product

- Protocol lead (Cosmos SDK, state machine design).
- Protocol engineer (Go/Cosmos SDK, core modules and protobufs).
- Cryptography and formal review (cryptographic assumptions, signing posture, key-safety patterns).
- Data/indexer engineer (schema, ingestion, reproducible reporting outputs).
- Frontend engineer (Explorer and operator console UX).
- SDK/integration engineer (clients, examples, conformance helpers).
- DevOps/SRE (environments, CI/CD, monitoring, release automation).
- Product design (UX/UI, information design, visual system).

### Security and assurance

- Security lead (threat model, audits, disclosure process, bug bounty).
- QA/test engineering (conformance tests, regressions, upgrade rehearsal support).

### Program and coordination

- Product/ops coordinator (requirements, roadmap coordination, external feedback loop).
- Technical writing and documentation (public docs hygiene, spec alignment).
- Legal/policy coordination (work with independent counsel; keep public posture conservative).
- Communications and public presence (PR/media, social media, events/speaking, positioning, SEO/content strategy).

## Phase 1 roles

Phase 1 begins at mainnet launch. Roles below cover sustained operations and ecosystem integration.

### Mainnet operations

- Protocol release manager (upgrades, changelogs, coordination).
- Governance and policy coordinator (process, safety checks, proposal readiness).
- Security operations (monitoring, incident response coordination, audit follow-up).

### Ecosystem and support

- Ecosystem support and integration lead (DevRel, partner onboarding, support).
- Documentation and standards maintenance (spec evolution, interoperability guidance).

### Operations and stewardship

- Treasury/finance operations (budgeting, vendor management, reporting).
- Partnerships and BD (infrastructure partners, validators, institutions).
- Legal and compliance operations (contracts, disclosures, risk posture; coordination with counsel).
- Brand and content (design, messaging, SEO, launch communications).
- Public relations and events (media relations, conference presence, speaking programs, and announcements).
- Token and digital-asset operations (if applicable; illustrative: ICO/IDO operations): distribution operations, exchange relations, market operations, and reporting—without implying any sale, listing, or return.

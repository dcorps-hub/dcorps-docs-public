---

## Phase 0 - Static public site (current)

- Maintain the static site in `../dcorps-site`.
- Publish high-level protocol and ecosystem content.

---

## Phase 1 - Read-only explorer and registry

- Build a read-only explorer view powered by indexer data.
- Publish entity registry views and module status.
- Link public docs and specs from the UI.

Dependencies: indexer availability and API definitions.

---

## Phase 2 - Wallet-connected console

- Add wallet-connected flows for entity management.
- Support role-based actions (governance, wallet updates, module attachment).
- Provide clear signing and transaction summaries.

Dependencies: stable API surface and wallet integration decisions.

---

## Phase 3 - Dashboards and advanced reporting

- Add reporting dashboards for cash-based and nonprofit allocation views.
- Add anchored evidence views and audit signals.
- Support module-specific outputs (jurisdiction status, sector metrics).

Dependencies: reporting schemas and module outputs.

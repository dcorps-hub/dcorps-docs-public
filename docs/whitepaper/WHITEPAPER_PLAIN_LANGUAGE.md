## Disclaimer

Nothing in this document is:

- an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any token, share, or security;
- investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice; or

## What dCorps is (in plain terms)

dCorps is shared public infrastructure for serious organizations.

It lets an organization:

- register a canonical identity and public profile;
- define who has authority to act (roles, approvals, governance actions);
- operate using on-chain wallets and standardized accounting events; and
- anchor key documents and evidence by hash.

The goal is simple: make it possible for an outside party to verify **authority** and **money trails** from a shared public record, instead of relying on screenshots, private exports, or trust-me reporting.

## What v1 enables

In v1, an entity can:

1. Register an entity and bind canonical wallets and roles.
2. Route inflows/outflows through canonical wallets and emit tagged accounting events.
3. Produce reproducible cash-based operating and allocation summaries over any selected timeframe, derived from those tagged events.
4. Anchor key documents (governing documents, resolutions, evidence) by hash so they can be referenced without publishing private content.

If an entity uses these primitives consistently, a third party can verify:

- who had authority to act at a given time;
- what approvals or governance actions were recorded; and
- how period totals were derived from underlying ledger activity.

## What dCorps does not claim

dCorps is infrastructure. It does not provide:

- custody, banking, brokerage, or exchange services;
- guaranteed legal recognition, regulatory outcomes, or institutional acceptance; or
- guaranteed financial outcomes for any asset.

---

## 1. Roles

- **Development corporation (DevCo)**: engineering, integrations, and delivery of protocol and tooling work. Planned DevCo entity: **dCorps Development Company (BVI)** (“dCorps Dev”; incorporation pending).

- **Research company (ResCo)** (optional): research, analysis, and publication work. Current ResCo entity: **dCorps Research LLC (Wyoming)**.

## 2. Funding and agreements

- The foundation may fund DevCo through milestone-based grants or service agreements.
- The foundation may fund ResCo for research work under similarly disclosed and scoped agreements.
- Funding is subject to governance oversight and public reporting.

---

## 3. IP and neutrality

- Protocol standards and core specifications remain public and neutral.
- The foundation may sponsor multiple providers to reduce single-vendor risk and avoid de facto exclusivity.

Design intention (IP stewardship transition):

- In early phases, protocol and brand IP may be held by the founder and/or DevCo once incorporated.
- Once the foundation is incorporated and operationally ready, stewardship is intended to migrate to the foundation via a documented arrangement (assignment and/or licensing as appropriate).
- Any IP transition should be publicly disclosed with clear scope, so observers do not need to infer ownership from narrative docs.

---

## 4. Conflict management

- Material conflicts must be disclosed by decision makers.
- Recusal is required for conflicts related to grants or registry decisions.

---

## 5. Change control

Any material change to this relationship must be documented in governance proposals and reflected in updates to this document.

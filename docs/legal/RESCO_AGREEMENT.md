## 1. Roles

- **Research company (ResCo)**: planned adoption-focused research organization. Planned ResCo legal entity (design intention): **dCorps Research LLC** (intended jurisdiction: **Wyoming (USA)**; incorporation pending).
- **DevCo (active)**: engineering delivery of protocol and tooling work. Legal entity: **dCorps Development Ltd.** (jurisdiction: **British Virgin Islands (BVI)**; incorporated; active) (see [DevCo Agreement](/legal/DEVCO_AGREEMENT)).
- **Foundation (planned; not yet incorporated)**: intended steward of public goods and ecosystem programs (see [Foundation Policy](/policy/POL-FOUNDATION)).

## 2. Funding and agreements

- ResCo work may be funded or commissioned through disclosed agreements (research grants, publication support, commissioned analysis).
- Where the foundation exists, it may fund ResCo work under transparent reporting and conflict-of-interest rules.
- Funding does not imply protocol authority and is not a guarantee of outcomes.

ResCo work is intended to focus on dCorps Hub and protocol adoption, including:

- analyzing adoption requirements across engineering, policy, legal, and operational constraints, and
- translating findings into module proposals and integration plans for specific jurisdictions, states, sectors, and industries (non-binding; subject to governance, audits, and legal constraints), including cooperative regulated-rail integrations such as CBDC-style instruments where feasible.

---

## 3. IP and neutrality

- Core protocol standards and specifications are intended to remain public and neutral.
- Research outputs may be published under open terms where appropriate, or under clearly disclosed licenses if not.
- IP stewardship must transfer to the foundation before mainnet through a documented arrangement.
- Any IP stewardship transition to a future foundation should be disclosed explicitly with scope and boundaries.

---

## 4. Conflict management

- Material conflicts should be disclosed by decision makers.
- Recusal is expected for conflicts related to grants, vendor selection, or registry decisions.

---

## 5. Change control

Any material change to this relationship should be reflected in updates to this document and, once on-chain governance is live, documented through governance processes where applicable.

- Where the foundation exists, it may fund ResCo work under transparent reporting and conflict-of-interest rules.
- Funding does not imply protocol authority and is not a guarantee of outcomes.

## 3. IP and neutrality

- Core protocol standards and specifications are intended to remain public and neutral.
- Research outputs may be published under open terms where appropriate, or under clearly disclosed licenses if not.
- Any IP stewardship transition to a future foundation should be disclosed explicitly with scope and boundaries.

## 4. Conflict management

- Material conflicts should be disclosed by decision makers.
- Recusal is expected for conflicts related to grants, vendor selection, or registry decisions.

## 5. Change control

Any material change to this relationship should be reflected in updates to this document and, once on-chain governance is live, documented through governance processes where applicable.

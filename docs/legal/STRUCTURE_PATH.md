## 1. Current posture (early phase)

Status note: dCorps is in Phase 0A (development). Mainnet is not live and the foundation is not incorporated yet.

Current posture (design intention + current facts):

- **DevCo (planned)**: **dCorps Development Company (BVI)** (“dCorps Dev”) is the intended development company; incorporation is pending.
- **ResCo (current)**: **dCorps Research LLC (Wyoming)** supports research and publications.
- Early work focuses on protocol engineering, reference tooling, and public documentation.
- This structure is not intended to create a custody or financial intermediation role.

## 2. Transition posture (maturity phase)

- Establish a nonprofit foundation in Switzerland or a comparable jurisdiction.
- Transfer stewardship of shared standards and public goods to the foundation.
- Retain protocol neutrality and reduce single-vendor dependence.
  - This includes making any IP stewardship arrangement explicit (see [docs/policy/POL-GOV-TRANSITION.md](/policy/POL-GOV-TRANSITION), [docs/legal/DEVCO_AGREEMENT.md](/legal/DEVCO_AGREEMENT), and [docs/legal/RESCO_AGREEMENT.md](/legal/RESCO_AGREEMENT)).

## 3. Triggers and readiness signals

- Public testnet artifacts and reproducible tooling published.
- Governance processes operational with clear thresholds.
- Ecosystem contributors beyond the founding team are active.

---

## 4. Change control

Any material change to the legal structure path should be reflected in updates to this document and, once on-chain governance is live, documented via governance proposals where applicable.

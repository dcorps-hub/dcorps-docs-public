> Scope: Jurisdictional eligibility summary for access to investor materials. Informational only.

---

## 1. Scope and posture

- dCorps is based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).
- Access to investor materials is restricted to accredited or professional investors as defined by applicable law.
- This summary is not legal, tax, or investment advice.
- Criteria may change; verification is required.

---

## 2. Why accreditation exists

- Accreditation gates help ensure investor materials are shared only with eligible recipients.
- They reduce legal and regulatory risk for dCorps and for recipients who must follow local rules.
- The gate is a compliance safeguard only; it is not a promise of access or allocation.

---

## 3. Verification posture (applies everywhere)

- We may require documentation or third-party confirmation.
- Eligibility is not guaranteed; requests may be declined in any jurisdiction.
- Any access decision is a compliance safeguard, not a promise of availability.

---

## 4. Access process (high-level)

1. Contact dCorps through the standard contact channel and request investor access.
2. Provide your jurisdiction and confirmation of accredited or professional investor status.
3. Provide supporting documents or a professional letter if required by local rules.
4. Requests are reviewed; approval may be granted or denied.
5. If approved, access is provisioned to the investor portal.

## Core disclaimers

Nothing in the dCorps documentation, including the whitepaper suite and related materials, is:

- an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any token, share, or security;
- investment, legal, tax, accounting, or financial advice; or
- a promise of listing, price performance, or financial return for any asset.

dCorps documentation describes a technical and economic design as currently envisioned. Details may change with engineering work, legal advice, market conditions, and community input.

Any token sale, equity financing, or legal agreement (if any) will be governed by its own dedicated documentation and terms, not by the dCorps public documentation.

## No custody, no intermediation

dCorps is intended to be infrastructure. It is not:

- a bank, broker, dealer, exchange, matching engine, or fundraising platform; or
- a custodial service.

Entities and users are responsible for their own key management, custody decisions, and security practices.

---

## No compliance guarantees

dCorps does not provide legal personhood, limited liability, or guaranteed compliance in any jurisdiction.

Legal status, filings, reporting obligations, and enforcement remain off-chain and jurisdiction-dependent. Optional jurisdiction adapter modules may support recognition workflows, but legal effect comes from local law and contracts that reference those workflows.

## Third-party services and tooling

Applications, wallets, explorers, indexers, custodians, auditors, and other service providers may be operated by third parties. dCorps does not guarantee the safety, quality, or availability of third-party services.

---

## Responsibility and professional advice

Participants are responsible for:

- obtaining professional advice appropriate to their circumstances; and
- complying with applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions.

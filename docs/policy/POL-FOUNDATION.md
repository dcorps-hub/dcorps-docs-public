> Scope: Governance, mission, and operating principles of the dCorps Foundation as a nonprofit steward of the protocol.

Status note: The dCorps Foundation has not been incorporated yet. This document describes design intention for a future foundation and does not represent an existing legal entity, charter, or executed governance arrangement.

## 1. Mission and scope

The planned dCorps Foundation is intended to:

- steward the long-term health and neutrality of the dCorps protocol;
- fund and support development, research, and ecosystem growth;
- engage with regulators, jurisdictions, and partners on behalf of the ecosystem;
- act as a bridge between on-chain governance and off-chain legal and financial realities.

The foundation does not control the protocol unilaterally; it operates within the bounds of on-chain governance decisions and legal obligations.

---

## 2. Board and committees

The foundation is intended to be overseen by a board of directors or trustees that:

- sets strategic direction within the mission;
- approves budgets and major commitments;
- appoints and supervises executive leadership.

The board may establish committees (e.g. audit, grants, security) with:

- clear charters and scopes;
- defined membership and reporting lines;
- no authority beyond that delegated by the board.

Board composition should:

- include a mix of technical, legal, and ecosystem expertise;
- reflect diversity of perspectives and geographies where feasible;
- avoid concentrations of control that undermine neutrality.

---

## 3. Conflicts of interest and ethics

Board members, executives, and key staff:

- disclose material conflicts of interest (e.g. large holdings, roles in partner organizations);
- recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts are significant;
- avoid using insider information for personal gain.

The foundation is intended to maintain:

- a written code of ethics;
- procedures for handling complaints or alleged misconduct;
- transparency around any related-party transactions, subject to legal constraints.

---

## 4. Relationship to on-chain governance

The foundation:

- may propose on-chain governance actions (upgrades, parameter changes, funding);
- may execute on-chain decisions where off-chain actions are required (e.g. treasury disbursements, contracts);
- must respect the outcomes of legitimate on-chain governance, subject to legal obligations and risk constraints.

In cases where legal obligations prevent the foundation from executing a governance decision as written:

- it communicates constraints clearly and promptly;
- it proposes alternative implementations or mitigations where possible;
- it documents the divergence and rationale.

The long-term objective is to reduce reliance on any single legal entity, including the foundation, as decentralized governance and tooling mature.

---

## 5. Transparency, reporting, and audits

The foundation:

- publishes annual reports summarizing activities, finances, and major decisions;
- provides regular updates on grants, partnerships, and research initiatives;
- undergoes independent financial audits as required by applicable law and best practices.

Where possible, the foundation:

- uses the dCorps Hub itself for its own governance evidence and financial flows;
- tags and reports its on-chain activity using standard schemas, serving as a reference implementation for others.

---

## 6. Current status (Phase 0A)

- The foundation is not incorporated yet, and timing is not finalized (see [docs/policy/POL-GOV-TRANSITION.md](/policy/POL-GOV-TRANSITION)).
- Any future incorporation details (jurisdiction, board, charter, conflict policies) will be published when finalized.
- Any future IP stewardship or asset custody arrangements will be documented explicitly and should not be inferred from this policy.

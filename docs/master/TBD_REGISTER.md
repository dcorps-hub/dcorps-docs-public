# TBD Register (Open Questions)

> Purpose: Central register of open questions, assumptions, and items marked as TBD in the Master Reference and related specs.

## 1. How to use this file

- Every `[OPEN-QUESTION]` or TBD in `DCHUB_MASTER.md` and specs should map to a **TBD ID** here.
- When a TBD is resolved, link it to a **Decision ID** in `DECISION_LOG.md`.
- Keep descriptions short; detailed discussion should live in issues, ADRs, or design docs.

Recommended column definitions:

- **TBD ID** – Stable identifier like `TBD-0001`.
- **Title** – One-line description of the question.
- **Context** – Where this appears (section/file).
- **Owner** – Person or team responsible.
- **Status** – e.g. OPEN, IN DISCUSSION, DECIDED, DROPPED.
- **Decision ID** – Link to `DECISION_LOG.md` when resolved.

## 2. TBD index

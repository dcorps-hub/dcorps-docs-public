# Decision Log

> Purpose: Track design and governance decisions that affect the protocol, specs, policies, and schemas.

## 1. How to use this file

- Each decision gets a **Decision ID** used across specs and code (e.g. `DEC-0001`).
- Link back to the originating TBD in `TBD_REGISTER.md` or to an issue/PR.
- Capture enough context and rationale that future contributors can understand _why_ the decision was made.

Recommended column definitions:

- **Decision ID** – Stable identifier like `DEC-0001`.
- **Title** – Short human-readable name.
- **Date** – Decision date (UTC).
- **Context / Origin** – Reference to TBD, issue, or section.
- **Decision** – Concise statement of what was decided.
- **Rationale** – Key reasons and tradeoffs.
- **Impacted artifacts** – Specs, modules, contracts, or tooling.

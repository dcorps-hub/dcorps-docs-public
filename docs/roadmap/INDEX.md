## Execution phases (source-of-truth roadmap)

These phases follow the Master Reference (section 16). Phase 0 is pre-mainnet readiness. Phases 1 to 5 start at mainnet launch.

**Phase 0: Pre-mainnet readiness**
- Publish specs, code, and verifiable testnet artifacts.
- Provide reproducible tooling and example entity package.

**Phase 1: Mainnet launch (Kernel v1)**
- Launch stable Hub with core entity models and registries.
- Provide reference explorer and indexer.

**Phase 2: Operational completeness and standards hardening**
- Conformance tests, stable APIs/SDKs, monitoring, and incident processes.

**Phase 3: Ecosystem bootstrapping and stablecoin rails**
- IBC stablecoin connectivity, registry systems, and reference UIs.

**Phase 4: Adapter layer and institutional legibility**
- Jurisdiction adapters, attestation modules, and institutional overlays.

**Phase 5: Fully operational maturity**
- Decentralized operations, multiple independent tooling stacks, and sustainable governance.

See detailed goals and exit criteria in `docs/roadmap/PHASES.md`.

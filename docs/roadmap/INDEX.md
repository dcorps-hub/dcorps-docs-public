## Execution phases (source-of-truth roadmap)

These phases follow the Whitepaper Long (section 16) with a pre-phase for website finalization. Phase 0 is pre-mainnet readiness. Phases 1 to 5 start at mainnet launch.

**Phase 0A: Public website finalization (static)**
- Finalize the static public website and align copy to public docs.

**Phase 0: Pre-mainnet readiness**
- Publish specs, code, and verifiable testnet artifacts.
- Provide reproducible tooling and example entity package.

**Phase 1: Mainnet launch (Kernel v1)**
- Launch stable Hub with core entity models and registries.
- Provide reference explorer and indexer.

**Phase 2: Operational completeness and standards hardening**
- Conformance tests, stable APIs/SDKs, monitoring, and incident processes.

**Phase 3: Ecosystem bootstrapping and stablecoin rails**
- IBC stablecoin connectivity, registry systems, and reference UIs.

**Phase 4: Adapter layer and institutional legibility**
- Jurisdiction adapters, attestation modules, and institutional overlays.

**Phase 5: Fully operational maturity**
- Decentralized operations, multiple independent tooling stacks, and sustainable governance.

See detailed goals and exit criteria in [docs/roadmap/PHASES.md](/roadmap/PHASES).

## Public roadmap (website summary)

The website maintains a public summary in:

- `../dcorps-site/roadmap/dev-phases/index.html` (Phases 0A to 5)
- `../dcorps-site/roadmap/adoption-tracks/index.html` (optional overlays, including Smart Jurisdiction adoption)

## Vision events (longer-term sequence)

From `../dcorps-site/learn/vision/index.html`:

1. First Hub corporation in production
2. First Hub nonprofit in production
3. Counterparty trust without jurisdiction integration
4. Human bridge: delegated filing providers (Pilot Step 0)
5. Jurisdiction modules mature (Pilot Step 1 → Step 2)
6. Typed workflows and interoperable tooling
7. Professional assurance becomes routine
8. Serious Web3 operators adopt the Hub
9. Networks coordinate on shared rails
10. Public data and research layer
11. Global soft standard and infrastructure status
12. DCHUB economics

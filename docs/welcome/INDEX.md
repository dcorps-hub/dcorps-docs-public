## What this docs center is

This is the public documentation set for dCorps and the DCHUB Hub chain: specs, policy, security posture, token documents, roadmap notes, and supporting materials.

Internal playbooks and working documents are maintained separately and are not published here.

Current status: Phase 0A (development). Mainnet is not live, the foundation is not incorporated, and DevCo incorporation is pending.

## How to read claims

- When a document says **design intention**, treat it as a target posture that may change through audits, governance decisions, and legal constraints.
- For protocol behavior, defer to the normative spec set: [docs/spec/*](/spec).

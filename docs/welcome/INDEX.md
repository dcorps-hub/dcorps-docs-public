## What this project is

dCorps is building a digitally native base layer for corporations and nonprofits that can be born and operated on-chain. This repo contains the canonical public documentation set: the master reference, protocol specs, governance and policy, security posture, token economics, and supporting technical guides.

These Markdown files are the source of truth for the docs center; the public website syncs documentation from this repository.

## Publication and safety note

Documentation in this repo is public by default. Safety-sensitive operational content belongs in the private documentation repo under `dcorps-docs-private/docs/restricted/` (policy: [docs/policy/POL-DOCS-PUBLICATION.md](/policy/POL-DOCS-PUBLICATION)).

---

## Conventions

Each doc starts with a header block that includes `Document type`, `Doc ID`, status, source path, and publishing metadata. Specs in `docs/spec/` are normative; most other docs are descriptive guidance or policy.
